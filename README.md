# Assignment

## Setup Instructions:
1. You don't need to separately install anything. If you run the code sequentially, the required modules will be automatically installed.

---

## Observations:
1. The assignment provided a good understanding of how **vector databases** and **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** are used for building **LLMs**.
2. It demonstrated how **LLMs** can be customized to suit specific use cases.

## Key Insights from Implementation:

### ASR Task:
- While working on the ASR task, I faced challenges finding **model checkpoints** from the GitHub repository provided. 
- Despite spending considerable time on this, I couldn’t resolve the issue. However, I used **Torch** to run the downloaded model(ai4b_indiConformer_hi.nemo), and though it worked, I couldn’t complete the implementation.

### Sarvam Translation:(Task 4)
- **Sarvam Translation** didn’t translate text to English as required. Instead, it was only able to translate from English to other languages, which wasn’t suitable for the assignment.

### RAG Implementation:
- Implementing **RAG** (Task 5) was challenging. Since Task 3 wasn’t fully completed, I couldn’t run the code entirely. However, I’ve provided the code that should give a reasonable result.

---

## Task Organization:

### Task 1 & Task 2:
- These two tasks were based on the same Wikipedia article, so I implemented them together for ease of execution.

### Task 3 & Task 5:
- I combined **Task 3** and **Task 5** as they are closely related. Task 5 was an extension of Task 3. Nonetheless, I’ve demonstrated Task 5 separately as well.

---

## Bonus Task:
- As a **bonus task**, I implemented **Streamlit** for **Task 5** to provide a simple UI for interacting with the chatbot.
